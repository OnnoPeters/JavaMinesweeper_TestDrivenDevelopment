# JavaMinesweeper_TestDrivenDevelopment
The classic game of Minesweeper developed in Java with the purpose of exploring unit tests and experimenting with the software development process of "Test-driven development", in which requirements are converted into tests before the actual software is written.

For every feature in this program (excluding the UI), the tests cases the functionality had to fulfill were written first and only then was the actual feature implemented.
